# Random Quote Generator Website

Welcome to the Random Quote Generator website! This simple web application generates a random quote each time you click a button. It's a fun and easy way to discover new quotes and get a dose of inspiration.

## Features

- **Random Quote Generation:** Click the "Generate Quote" button to get a randomly selected quote.
- **Dynamic Content:** The website uses JavaScript to dynamically update the quote without refreshing the page.
- **Clean and Simple Design:** The user interface is straightforward, focusing on the essential functionality.

## How it Works

The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

1. **HTML:** The structure of the webpage is defined using HTML. It includes a container for the quote and a button to trigger the quote generation.

2. **CSS:** Styling is applied using CSS to make the website visually appealing and responsive.

3. **JavaScript:** The magic happens with JavaScript. An array of quotes is stored, and when the "Generate Quote" button is clicked, a random quote is selected from the array and displayed on the webpage.

## Usage
Simply open the index.html file in a web browser, and you'll see the website. Click the "Generate Quote" button to get a new quote each time.
